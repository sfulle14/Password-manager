Working with security principles to implement and expand on what I have learned in my security classes.

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Branches
### Main
Main will hold the working template without any encryption of the data.

### Lazy-sha
This branch will be used to implement user login password hashing with a prepackaged python library.
=======
## Lazy sha
For this branch I implemented user password hashing using the hashlib package already created for python as a simple solution to user login password management.

There is no encryption implemented on the passwords being stored within the application in this branch.
